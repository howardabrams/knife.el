;;
;;  Build knife commands from completing read functions and execute
;;  the results.
;;
;;  Anyone who plays with Chef's `knife' command realizes that, while
;;  flexible, has a dizzying array of options, commands, sub-commands
;;  and sometimes, sub-sub-commands. I figured that I could use the
;;  IDO's `ido-completing-read' function at each step along the way to
;;  build up the command line. Once you've executed it once, it
;;  remembers it, so that calling `M-x knife' again, allows you to
;;  select a previous knife call, or create another.
;;
;;  If you're `knife' command work with the default configuration
;;  file, then you can start a `knife client show' or `knife node
;;  show', it will automatically populate the list of the available
;;  nodes.
;;
;;  If the command typed ends with a -c, it prompts for a knife
;;  configuration file (change the `knife--config-directory' for the
;;  default directory for this).
;;
;;  If the command typed ends with a -o, it prompts for a directory
;;  containing the cookbook you want to upload (change the
;;  `knife--repository-directory' for the default directory value for
;;  this).

;;
;;; Change log:
;;
;;   - v.1.0 :: Banged out while waiting for a Jenkins build job
;;
;;   - v.1.1 :: Created a `history' ring to choose past commands
;;              Refactored the code to be more readable
;;
;;   - v.1.2 :: Pulled out hard-coded strings into customizable values.
;;
;;   - v.1.3 :: Init files can pre-load knife commands into the
;;              `knife--previous-commands' list, these should not
;;              contain the `knife' command, as the variable,
;;              `knife--knife-command' will be automatically
;;              pre-pended to it.
;;
;;              Note: if you customize the command, your previous
;;              choices will *appear* with an initial `knife' command,
;;              but it uses your command during execution.
;;
;;   - v.1.4 :: Starting a sub-command to `knife node' or `knife
;;              client' will pre-populate it with the list of
;;              available nodes or clients.
